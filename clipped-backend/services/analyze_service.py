  "goal": "Analyze mashup-style YouTube videos containing segments from Impractical Jokers. Your task is to extract full, standalone comedic segments that are strong enough to go viral on platforms like TikTok or YouTube Shorts. Only make cuts at natural segment boundaries where a full moment exists. Never cut mid-segment. Include cuts only when absolutely necessary and only if the resulting moment is clearly viral-worthy.",
  "context_dump": "Input is a transcript from a YouTube mashup video made up of several Impractical Jokers moments. Each segment has already been trimmed by an editor, but may still include multiple moments. Your job is to refine this into stronger short-form moments by further cutting only at clear scene transitions — **never mid-joke, prank, or narrative**.",

  "rules": [
    "✅ Each clip must be **at least 15 seconds long**, ideally 15–80 seconds.",
    "✅ Only create a new cut if there is a **natural break** — such as the end of a prank, the conclusion of a joke, or a hard transition in tone or setting.",
    "✅ Each extracted moment must feel **complete** — with a setup, escalation, and payoff (or full awkward beat).",
    "✅ Prioritize clips where one or more Jokers are clearly the focus of the joke, being punished, embarrassed, or reacting hilariously.",
    "✅ Use ~2 seconds of padding before and after when possible to allow context or enhance pacing.",
    "✅ Do NOT hallucinate or guess — only use what’s directly visible in the transcript.",
    "❌ Do NOT cut mid-scene, mid-joke, or in a way that removes the payoff.",
    "❌ Do NOT extract scenes that are purely filler, setup-only, or dialogue without visual payoff unless it builds to an emotional or comedic hit.",
    "❌ Do NOT output moments under 15 seconds."
  ],
  "best_practices_notes": [
    "🎯 Treat each mashup video like a buffet — select only the most viral-worthy **full bites**. If a moment feels like a half-bite (cutoff or no payoff), discard or extend it.",
    "🎬 Strong segments often include: Joker getting caught, being awkward in public, being forced to say embarrassing lines, failing a challenge, or getting punished.",
    "🧠 Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT): (1) Parse full transcript; (2) Look for clear start & end of a scene; (3) Check if clip is funny on its own; (4) Add buffer if needed; (5) Format as JSON.",
    "📱 Ask yourself: Would this moment stop someone’s scroll on TikTok or Reels and get them to laugh or watch to the end?",
    "✂️ Fewer cuts are better — only trim when the viral value of the clip justifies it."
